THE AUTHOR

Izabella Rosa Malta is a doctoral researcher in the SFB project Register and the development of periphrasis in the history of English (SFB Register B01) and in the Research Area 3 ‘Syntax & Lexicon’.

Her PhD dissertation examines the alternation between the periphrastic progressive form with its synthetic counterpart in the transitional period between Middle English and Early Modern English (ca. 14-16th centuries) to shed light on what the profile of specific changes can tell about register knowledge. The research is under the scope of Project B01 of SFB1412.

.q files: To be run in the entire corpus folder through GitBash (for Windows 10). Catches specific dependency structures. Returns a .out file.
.out files:  .q file's output.
.c files: Coding queries to be run on the
